Hello!

https://learnopengl.com/ 

We used learnopengl a LOT for guidance. They provide tutorials on how to implement just about everything we implemented here, 
from shadows to shaders, textures, materials and so on. Im not just trying to be a wizard. 

Right now the system is kind of rigid. It only supports a single light and doesnt support textures.

Anyways, other non-graphical features:

WASD: move the light's (x,z) coords.
Space: Launch the ball.
